# WebChat
This is a simple web chat that uses a javascript client and a Java websockets server.  The user connects to the chat, chooses a chat room and then he can start to chat. He will see only the messages that are posted after he enters the chat room. The javascript sends and receives information about the room (where to send and receive messages) ,message, date in a JSON format via the websocket. The server has a server endpoint "/chat/{room}", opens a session and adds the room where to chat in the "User Properties" for the new user.  It has also a class to decode the json message from the javascript clients, and store the message properties and a encode class that will transform the text into a json message to be sent. Finnaly, the server will pass through all sessions and send the chat messages to all the clients connected.
